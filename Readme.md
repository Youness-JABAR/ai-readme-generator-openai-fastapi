# AI README GENERATOR

Welcome to the AI README GENERATOR project! This tool simplifies the process of creating README files for your projects by automatically generating Markdown content based on the information in your `package.json` file.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a boilerplate for integrating OpenAI's API into a FastAPI project.With this project, I aim to provide a straightforward and helpful example to assist those who are new to OpenAI API integration.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AI README GENERATOR, follow these steps:

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the project dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Youness-JABAR/ai-readme-generator-openai-fastapi.git

# Change to the project directory
cd AI-README-GENERATOR

# Install dependencies
```

### Configuration

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable for the project:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Usage

You can use the AI README GENERATOR to automatically generate README content for your project. Here's an example of how to do it:

```bash
# Example of how to generate a README
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"prompt_input": "Your package.json content here"}' http://localhost:8000/generate_readme/
```

## How It Works

The AI README GENERATOR backend part analyzes the content of your `package.json` file and utilizes this information to dynamically create the Markdown content for your project's README.md file. This automation can save you time and ensure that your README is always up to date with your project's metadata.
